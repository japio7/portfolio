# DATA SCIENCE TOOLS 2 FINAL PROJECT

## Project written in Python

## Details
A dataset of houses will be explored and analyzed displaying visualizations
of relationships by datamining. There will be four machine learning regression
algorithms used to predict the price of houses based on their features.
<br><br>Research Question: Can the price of a house be predicted by regression and which model is best?
<br>Methods: Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Ridge Regression
<br>Type: Regression
